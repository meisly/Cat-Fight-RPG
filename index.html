                <strong>Bio:</strong> Unlike the other fighters in this tournament Cat Truck is not a biological cat.
                Made of steel, shiny chrome, yellow paint and full of the fruits of the industrial revolution Cat Truck
                is one stubborn piece of equipment. Tempered in the mines of Appalachia, Cat Truck is ready to try their
                metal here and now in the CAT FIGHT.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong as steel, literally, Cat Truck is one hard fighter who is ready to
                push through the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Cat Truck may be big but they sure aren't fast. Hit first and hit hard and
                you might just be able to take down our competitor of steel.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Bio:</strong> Cat Stevens may be a pacifist but he won't be content just to turn the other cheek in this tournament. The only certified human to compete the in the Cat Fight Cat Stevens may be a long shot to win but if you make him angry expect don't be surprised to learn that this cat has some sharp claws.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> Cat Stevens has the sharp ears and quick hands of professional musician.  You won't be able to catch him unawares.  And this pacifist is not afraid to fight back!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> As an avowed pacifist there are rumors that Cat Stevens is not in this tournament by his own choice.  This may cause him to hesitate or hold back on attack.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Bio:</strong> Long an internet hero, Grumpy Cat has decided to show their mettle in this Cat Fight! Grumpy Cat is tired of the annoying memes and they're here to show that they're a serious contender.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> Grumpy Cat may be a little old but they're here and they're mad as hell! Don't expect Grumpy to take it easy on you!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Sure Grumpy has cat reflexes and claws like daggers but don't forget they're just a little guy.  One good hit and you might be able to end the fight before it begins.

            <p>
                <strong>Bio:</strong> Although rumors that Katherine of Aragon is actually <em>that</em> Katherine can't be substantiated, there's good evidence that she's been alive for at least the past 150 years.  Gossip ranges from her being a vampire to a fairy and everything in-between.  Whatever she might be though it's probably not human.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> Although she hasn't previously participated in any publicized fighting events the rumor mill says that she's a hardy one.  Don't be fooled by her frail appearance.  Katherine of Aragon might just be a tank.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Well, you could try garlic.  It couldn't hurt at least.

        <div id="frenchie-bio" class="col-12 align-items-center bio hidden">
            <p>
                <strong>Bio:</strong> Frenchie was originally classified as a cat by a newly emerged and slightly befuddled AI.  Since that AI quickly matured and assumed overlordship of the planet earth, no one has seen fit to argue the point.  Frenchie is a good, natured cat who loves playing fetch and can't say no to a friendly compeition.  He's pretty sure he's the goodest cat in the tournament.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> Frenchie might not be the strongest fighter in the tournament but they're a strong oponent nonetheless.  They've got acute cat senses and an indomitable spirit.  Don't overlook them!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Frenchie's strong competitive spirit has been known to be shadowed by their love of balls and treats.  If you can distract them, you're sure to win!
