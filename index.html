                <strong>Bio:</strong> Unlike the other fighters in this tournament Cat Truck is not a biological cat.
                Made of steel, shiny chrome, yellow paint and full of the fruits of the industrial revolution Cat Truck
                is one stubborn piece of equipment. Tempered in the mines of Appalachia, Cat Truck is ready to try their
                metal here and now in the CAT FIGHT.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong as steel, literally, Cat Truck is one hard fighter who is ready to
                push through the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Cat Truck may be big but they sure aren't fast. Hit first and hit hard and
                you might just be able to take down our competitor of steel.
